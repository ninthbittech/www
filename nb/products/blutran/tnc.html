						<b>What is not covered?</b>
						<ul>
							<li>This Limited Warranty does not cover user manuals, accessories* or any third party software, settings, content, data or links, whether included or downloaded in the Product, whether included during installment, assembly, shipping or at any other time in the delivery chain or otherwise and in any way acquired by you. Ninth Bit does not warrant that any Nith Bit software will meet your requirements, will work in combination with any hardware or software provided by a third party, that the operation of any software will be uninterrupted or error free or that any defects in the software are correctable or will be corrected.</li>
							<li>This Limited Warranty does not cover a) normal wear and tear b) defects caused by rough handling (including, without limitation, defects caused by sharp items, by bending, compressing or dropping, etc.), or c) defects or damage caused by misuse of the Product, including use that is contrary to the instructions provided by Ninth Bit (e.g. as set out in the Product’s user guide) d) transport costs and/or e) other acts beyond the reasonable control of Ninth Bit.</li>
							<li>This Limited Warranty does not cover defects or alleged defects caused by the fact that the Product was used with, or connected to, any product, accessory, software and/or service not compatible with Ninth Bit or was used otherwise than for its intended use. Defects can be caused by viruses from your or from a third party’s unauthorised access to services, other accounts, computer systems or networks. This unauthorised access can take place through hacking, password mining or through a variety of other means.</li>
							<li>This Limited Warranty is not enforceable if the Product has been opened, modified or repaired by anyone other than an authorized service centre, if it is repaired using unauthorized spare parts, and this shall be determined in the sole discretion of Ninth Bit.</li>
							<li>This Limited Warranty is not enforceable if the Product has been exposed to moisture, to dampness or to extreme thermal or environmental conditions or to rapid changes in such conditions, to corrosion, to oxidation, to spillage of food or liquid or to influence from chemical products.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<dt>Refusals:</dt>

								<li><b>Total Ship Time = Availability Time + Delivery Method Ship Time. Choosing next day or second day air does not mean Buyer's order will be delivered in 1 or 2 days from the time order is placed online.</b> Shipping time is calculated as an estimate AFTER the order has been shipped out of our warehouse.</li>

						<dd>
							<ol>
								<li>All orders and contracts are subject to approval by the Seller's credit department.
